## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
**AI Stylist** is an intelligent recommendation engine built during my **Infosys Springboard internship** to democratize personalized styling. It combines **DNNs**, **collaborative filtering**, and **content-based filtering** to suggest outfits tailored to user preferences, body types, and occasions. This project bridges fashion expertise with scalable ML solutions.  

---

## 🔍 **Key Innovations**  
- **Complementary Mapping**: AI pairs items into cohesive outfits (e.g., suggests "Silver Earrings" for a "Black Saree" or "Red Heels" for contrast).   
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Merges collaborative patterns (user interactions) + content attributes (color, category).  
- **Visual & Contextual Fusion**: Uses image URLs for aesthetic analysis + season/occasion context.  
- **Rule-Driven Diversity**: Enforces gender alignment, unique categories, and style contrast in recommendations.

## 🛠️ **Technical Stack**  
- **Data**: Kaggle dataset (product metadata, images, ratings).  
- **Preprocessing**: PCA, K-Means clustering, and EDA with Python libraries (Pandas, Seaborn).  
- **Models**:  
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity.  
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix Factorization (SVD/PMF).  
  - **Hybrid DNN**: Embedding layers for users/items + rule-based post-processing.  
- **Metrics**: Precision@K, Recall@K, F1@K.

## 💡 **Why It Stands Out**  
### For Users:
- 🕒 Saves time with curated outfit suggestions.
- 🎨 Explores diverse styles while aligning with personal preferences.
- 💸 Affordable alternative to traditional styling services.

### For Businesses:
- 📈 Boosts customer retention and sales conversions.
- 📉 Reduces return rates via better product alignment.
- 🧠 Gains insights into consumer trends for inventory optimization.
